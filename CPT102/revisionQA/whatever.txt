• Both space efficiency & time efficiency are metrics used 
to evaluate the performance of an algorithm (and a data 
structure). (T or F?)

• Information hiding is the principle that users of a 
software component need to know only the essential 
details of how to initialize and access the component, 
and do not need to know t
