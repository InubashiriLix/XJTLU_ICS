# CPT102_NOTE

## BEFORE USE THIS

- the java collections implementations are not correct if you have seen the ppt
- but at least, it can run while ppt still have idiot wrong like

```java
public class Stack implements AbsStack {
    // fuck you!!!! CPT102 and your fucking shit ppt
}
```

- so the at leat my version can run...
- fuck you! CPT102!!!!
