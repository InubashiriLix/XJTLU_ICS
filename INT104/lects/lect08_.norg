* Decision Tree
** Intution behind a decision tree
*** Ask a series questions about a given record
   ~ each question is about one of the attribute
   ~ Answer to one question decides what question to ask next (or if a next question is needed)
   ~ Continue asking questions until we can infer the class of the given record
*** the decision treee si structure of such question and decide precedure
   ~ inner node: question
   ~ branch: the way to different path to other subtree
   ~ leaf node: when all the questions are done, the final label
*** Pros
    - easy to understand
    - each divide is based on a best attribute selection banch that make the tree as short, as shallow as possible
    - for new sample: we only to go through from root to leaf
** Structure of a decision tree
*** Hierarchical tree with three node types
*** Root node
    - No incoming edge, one or more outgoing edges
*** Internal nodes
    - Exactly one incoming edge, two or more outgoing edges
    - Each tests one attribute (e.g. "petal_length ≤ 1.5")
*** Leaf (terminal) nodes
    - Exactly one incoming edge, no outgoing edge
    - Assigned a class label (final decision)
*** Traversal
    - Follow tests from root → internal nodes → leaf
    - At each internal node, choose branch based on attribute value
    - Stop at leaf to read off predicted class
