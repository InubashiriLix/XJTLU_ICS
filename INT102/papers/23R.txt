PART2
Question1
1. Describe what a decision problem is and what an optimisation problem is.
decision problem asks a yes/no question about the input
optimisation problem asks for the best (min/max) solution and it's value

2. Describe what a P problem is and what a NP problem is.
P problem is the class of decision solvable in worst-case in polynomial time
NP problem is the class of decision problems whose yes-answer can be verified in polynomial time
but finding such solution can be difficult
A problem is NP-complete if it lies NP and every NP problem can be reduced to it in polynomial time
3. 
For each problem below, state whether it is a P problem or NP-complete problem.  
1. Vertex Cover Problem.  NP
2. Finding minimum spanning tree (MST) in a weighted undirected graph P
3. 0/1 Knapsack problem. NP
4. Finding the nth Fibonacci number. P
