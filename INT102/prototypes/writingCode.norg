* Write the code accroding to the given info

* Consider a string T of n char. Design and write a pseudo code of an algorithm to determine if a given character, donated by C, appears uniquely in T [0..(n-1)] 
    whether the char C appears exactly once in T
*** Sol.
    C = input
    cnt = 0
    for i = 0 to n - 1 do 
        if T\[i\] = C then
            cnt = cnt + 1
        end
    end
    if cnt = 1 then 
        return "Yes"
    else 
        return "No"
    end
