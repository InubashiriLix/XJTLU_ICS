The major difference between the von Neumann architecture and the Harvard
   architecture lies in
    A. bus speed B. separated data from program C. CPU
    D. use of secondary storage E. cache
*** Sol
    B
*** Note
    the VON NEUMANN arch and HARVARD arch have the main difference in cache
    the von neumann arch's data and program share the same memory, it is slower
    the harvard arch has separated memory for data and program, the separtaed memory 
    is through bus, and the cpu can fetch data and program simultaneously, 
    which is faster

Which of the following will not lead to load-time error?
    A. insufficient memory to load the program B. CPU is busy running another program
    C. named executable file is corrupted D. hard disk failure
    E. named executable file cannot be found
*** Sol
    B
*** Note
    A. insufficient memory: load-time error, as program cannot be loaded into memory.
    B. CPU busy: not a load-time error; OS schedules the program, but loading is not prevented.
    C. executable file corrupted: load-time error, as loader cannot interpret the file.
    D. hard disk failure: load-time error, as program cannot be read from disk.
    E. file not found: load-time error, as loader cannot locate the executable.

   What is the decimal equivalent of this unsigned 8-bit integer 10111101?
*** Options
    A. 111 B. 131 C. 151 D. 171 E. 189
*** Note
    10111101 = 128 + 1 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 160 + 1 + 4 + 8 + 16  = 180 + 9  =189

What is the decimal equivalent of this 8-bit signed integer 10111110 in 2's
   complement encoding?
    A. 43 B. -21 C. -58 D. -66 E. 74
*** Sol
    D
*** Note
    in 2's complement, the original number comethrough these shits
    opposite number -> invert all bits -> +1 -> 10111110
    so 10111110 -> 10111101 -> 01000010 -> +2 + 64 = 66
    so -66 => D

    A. yes, the program is called assembler, which is a separate program that translates assembly code to object code.
    B. nope, it is related to optimization level
    C. well, the semantic gap is relatively small, but it is not the main benefit
    D. nope, same as B and wheter the program you write is a piece of shit E. shit

    A. more user friendly compared to sign-magnitude encoding
    B. easy to compute C. efficient computation
    D. subtraction is absorbed by addition E. no duplicate exists when encoding 0
*** Sol
    A
*** Note
    A. -1 -> 0001 -> 1110 -> 1111, fuck no
    B. yes, go to D C. yes, goto D
    D. yes, if you try to add 1111 to 0001, which is -1 + 1,
    you will get 0000, which is, 0, the only ops we need is addition
    E. well, for sign-magnitude, it has -0 and +0, the complement only have 0000

Excess-49 notation for the 2-digit decimal exponent lets us encode the real
   exponent in which range?
    A. 0 .. 99 B. 1 .. 100 C. -50 .. 49 D. -49 .. 50
    E. none of the above
*** Sol
    boundary -> 10^2 / 2 = 50, 50 + 1 - 100 = -49
    D
*** Note
    With Excess-49 the stored value S = E + 49. 2-digit decimals span 00-99.  
    Thus E ranges from 00-49 → −49 to 50 and 99 → +50, i.e. −49 .. +50.

    - D: J-flip-flop
        - *K = 0, J = 0* → output maintains (保持不变)
        - *K = 0, J = 1* → output set to 1
        - *K = 1, J = 0* → output reset to 0
        - *K = 1, J = 1* → output toggles (翻转)
    - E: no such flip-flop

What are the main steps in a CPU cycle?
    A. Compile, link, execute instructions
    B. Interpret, translate to machine code, execute instructions
    C. Instruction fetch, decode instruction, data fetch, execute and store
    D. Data fetch, instruction fetch, decode instruction, execute and store
    E. Instruction fetch, data fetch, decode instruction, execute and store
*** Sol
    C
    the computer will first fetch the instruction
    because it need to know what operation to performa before it knows wheter it needs to fetch any data
    the typical instruction cycle is:
    Instruction fetch, Instruction decode, Data fetch, Execute, Store

      and multiple stack are on the stack at the same tim
    - D: nope, esp will automatically cahnge with ops, only in the especial case like context switch, it needed to be saved
    - E: in most call, the arguments are push into the stack

hardware is the physical components, EBCDIC and Unicode are character encoding schemes, ALU is the arithmetic logic unit that performs operations.
Assume Process A needs 10 pages of memory. When the CPU runs the process it
requests data from each page with equal probability.  
Average main-memory word read = 5 ns, average page read/write from disk = 3000 ns,
no caching, all pages dirty.  
Only 3 of the 10 pages are resident; a resident page must be swapped out before
a new one is brought in.  
What is the average access time to read a word of data?
    A. 5   B. 3005   C. 2105   D. 3000   E. 4205

*** Sol
    1 - 8 - 23
    first, negative, so S = 1
    second, E: 2^(n-127), the n could be 133 or 134, which is 64 or 128, but 1 * 64 < 123 < 1 * 128,
