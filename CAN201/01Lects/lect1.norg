** What is the network/internet?
   the network is a group of computers and other devices connected together 
   to share resources and information. The internet is a global network that 
   connects millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks.
   also, it includes almost all the projects

** terminals (devices / hosts)
*** hosts = end system: 
    the devices including computers, phones, iot devices run the internet application
    they located at the edge of network, and use the socket and TCP / UDP protocols to 
    commnucate with each other
*** packet switches:
    the router and swtiches to transport the data in packets
    these devices are cores of the internet, and use router and 
    _forwarding table_ to forward the packets
*** Communication links:
    - the physical media: lines, cables, radio spectrum
**** the key evaluation key is _bandwidth_: how many bytes can be sent in one second
     but the delay is not included, which depends on the distance, transport, queue, processing
*** the layers for internet
    ~ home network: device -> wifi / router + NAT
    ~ mobile network: device -> base station
    ~ enterprise network: from the inner network
    ~ location / local ISP -> global / national ISP: the commcom interlink with each other, 
      forming the skeleton of the intternet
    ~ content provider network and data center: the data center of google, facebook, CDN ...
** Nut and bolts view for internet
*** Internet = net in net
    the sum of home network, mobile network, enterprise network, ISP network, content provider network... 
    are internet
*** PROTOCOLs are EVERYWHERE
    the network is based on the protocols, which are the rules for communication
**** application layer:
     HTTP, Skype, Streaming video (HLS, DASH), email (SMTP, IMAP), P2P (BitTorrent)
**** transport layer:
     TCP, UDP, QUIC
**** network layer: 
     IP: which guide the network layer to forward the packets
**** Link / Access layer:
     Ethernet, WiFi, PPP, 4G, 5G 
     they take the responsibility to deliver the packets between two directly connected devices
*** All depends on guidence: IETF / RFC
   the protocols are defined by the IETF, and published as RFCs
    *** relevant concepts
**** CDN (Content Delivery Network)
     the distributed servers to deliver the content to users based on their geographic locations
**** ISP (Internet Service Provider)
     the company that provides internet access to users
**** NAT (Network address Translation)
     convert the private IP address to public IP address, and vice versa
     home network commonly use NAPT / PAT
*** Overview:
    device -> wifi (link layer) + NAT -> local ISP -> global ISP -> CDN / data center
    HTTP in application layer, TCP UDP -> cable / 4G / 5G

** Protocols
*** it defines
     - the format of info
     - the order of messages sent and received
     - action after receiving / sending messages
*** it is everywhere:
**** the application layer
      HTTP, DNS, HLS, DASH, RTMP
**** transport layer
      TCP, UDP, QUIC
**** network layer
      IP
**** link / access layer:
      ithernet, WiFi, PPP, 4G, 5G

*** what it is look like?
     TCP 3-way handshake + HTTP
     client SYN -> request
     server <- SYN-ACK (response, OK)
     cient: ACK -> confirm 
     client: GET /index.html -> application request
     server <- 200 OK + data

** Send Data and delay computation
*** Host sending fucntion:
    - Takes application message 
    - Breaks into smaller chunks
      know as _packets_, of length _L_ bits
    - transmit packets into access network at _transmission rate R_
    - link _transmission rate_, aka link _capacity_, aka _bamdwidth_

****  packet transmission delay = time needed to transmit L-bit packet into link = L(bits) / R(bits/sec)
      paccket trans delay = L / R (seconds)
      and this is only the bit to lknk layer time delay, and it is different from physical layer delay

** Pysical Layer
   pysical medias: 
*** Twisted pair (TP) (双绞线)
    two insulated copper wires
    - Category 5: 100 Mbps, 1Gps Ethernet
    - Category 6: 10 Gbps Ethernet

*** Coaxial cable (同轴电缆)
    - two concentric copper conductors
    - bidirectional
    - broadband
      multiple channels on cable 
      HFC

*** Fiber optic cable (光纤)
    - glass finer carrying light pulses, one pulse = a bit
    - high-speed operation:
      high-speed point-to-point transmission (10 - 100 Gbps transmissio rate)
    -  low error rate:
       repeaters spaced far apart
       Not affected by electromagneitc noise

*** radio
    - Sinal carried in eletromagnetic spectrum 

    - No pjysical wire
    - Bidiretion 
    - Propagation environment effects
      reflection
      Onbstruction
      Interference
**** Radio link types
     - Wireless LAN (wifi)
       54Mbps - 9.6Gbps
     - Wide-area (cellular)
       4G cellularr 100 Mbps
       5G cellular 1 Gbps
     - Satellite 
       Kbps to 45 Mbps channel (or multiple smaller channels)
       starink: 1440Mbps
       270msec end-end delay

** Different methods to access the internet
   - Early methods
     PSTN DSL TV net
   - Modern methods
     FTTH, Wireless
*** Dial-up Internet access (PSTN)
    - use _public switched telephone network_ (PSTN) -> internet service provider (ISP)
    - connection established via dialing a telephone number
    - Mordern are require to enabe communication: 
      decode audio signal to data for computer or routers
      they encode digital signals back into audio for transmission over phone lines

    - bandwidth 56 Kbps - 10 min for one mp3 music file
*** Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)
    - Telephone line based
      To central office DSL Access Multiplexer (DSLAM)
      Data over DSL phone line goes to internet
      Voice over DSL phone line goes to telephone net
    - Bandwidth
      Upstream transmission rate ~< 3 Mbps (typically < 1Mbps)
      Downstream transmission rate ~< 50 Mbps (typically < 10Mbps)
      ADSL = Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line

*** FTTH: fiber to the home
    optic network terminators -> Optical splitter -- Optical fibers --> Center office -> internet
    Central office + Internet = Optical line terminal 
    ↑ FTTH usng the passive optial network (PONs) distribution architecture
