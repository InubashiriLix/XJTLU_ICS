* Channel Partitioning Protocol:
** Core Idea:
partition the channel into several parts. each node can get one part, fairness;

** TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access):
- times are sliced into slots;
- each node's distribution is fixed to get multiple or single slot.
- each node can only send data in its own time slot.
*** Pros:
- Almost no collisions;
- Stable in high load;
*** Cons:
- low efficiency in low load:
  node can not send data even the other nodes are idle;
  (unless dynamic slot allocation is used, but it is complex)
- need time synchronization among nodes;
** FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple Access):
*** Key Idea:
- chop the Spectrum into multiple frequency bands;
- each node gets one band to send data;
*** Pros:
- Almost no collisions;
- Stable in high load: each node takes its own frequency band;
*** Cons:
- low efficiency in low load:
  node can not send data even the other nodes are idle;
  (unless dynamic slot allocation is used, but it is complex)
- need complex spectrum segmnetation design;
