* Taking Trurns:
** Key Idea: 
Polling the nodes one by one to see if they have data to send.
- there is usually an AP or master to control;

** Pros:
- basically no collision;
- fair and controlable;
** Cons:
polling costs;
control is single point of failure;
polling delay;

** Token Passing:
- send only when holding the token;
- pass the token to the next node after sending;

*** Pros:
- less collisions;
- fair, distributed control;
*** Cons:
token lost/restore;
cost of passing token;
topology limitation and complecity;

** Summary
- high load: stabler then random access;
- low lad: less waste, but require the extra ost of take turn machinism;
