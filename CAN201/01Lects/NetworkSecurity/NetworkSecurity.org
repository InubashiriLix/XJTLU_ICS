* Network Security:
** What is Network Security?
*** Confidentiality:
only sender, intended receiver should "understand" the message
- sender encrypts msg
- reader decrypts msg
*** Integrity:
sender, receiver want to ensure message *not altered* (in transit, or afterward) witout detection
*** Authentication:
sender, recv want to confirm identiry of each other
*** Access and Availability:
services must be accessible and available to users

** Principles of Encyrption
*** The Language of cryptography
A -> plaintext (original msg) -> KeyA (Encryption) -> ciphertext -> KeyB -> plaintext (decryption algorithm) -> B
- m: plaintext msg
- K_A(m): ciphertext, encrypted msg using Key A
- m = K_B(K_A(m)): decryption of ciphertext using Key B to get original msg m

** Symmetric Key Cryptography
[[./SymmetricKeyCryptography.org]]
both side use the same key for encryption and decryption

- Caesar Cipher
- Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipher
- DES (Data Ecnryption Standard)
- AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)

** Public key crypto: 
[[./PublicKeyCrypto.org]]
*feature*: no first time shared secret key needed
have a public key and a private key
- public key: known to everyone, used for encryption
- private key: known only to owner, used for decryption
- RSA Algorithm:

| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- |
| Symmetric crypto        | 1. you have to share the same secret key with another end, 2. requiring safe way to deliver this. 3. N's user sending to each other requiring (N-1)*N shared keys | fast |
| asymmetric / public-key | 1. slow. computing cost high. 2. still have confirmation and trust issues. 3. length of key, imple hard.                                                          | fast |
| current solution:       | hybrid encryption: use asymmetric / public-key to establish the safe channnel for symmetric key. then use symmetric key to transport the data.                    |      |
