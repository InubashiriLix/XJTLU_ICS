* Symmetric Key Cryptography
both side use the same key for encryption and decryption

*some ancient cryptographic techniques*
** Caesar Cipher
move all the char to some bits down the alphabet
- simple and stupid
  
** Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipher
- substitute each letter with another letter
  
  *Modern Cryptographic Techniques*
** DES (Data Encryption Standard) (historical):
- US encryption standard [NIST 1993]
- 56-bit symmetric key, 64-bit plaintext input
- block cipher with cipher block chaining
- how secure is DES:
  - DES chanllenge: 56-bit-key-encrypted phrase decrypted (brute-force) in less than a day
  - Weak by modern standards
- making DES more secure:
  - 3DES: encrypt 3 times with 3 different keys
    
** AES: Advanced Encryption Standard (current):
- symmetric-key NIST standard, replaced DES (NOV 2001)
- processes data in 128 bit blocks, key length 128, 192, 256
- brute-force infeasible for all key lengths
