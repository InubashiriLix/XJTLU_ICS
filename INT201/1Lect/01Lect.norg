   ~ mathematics properties of computer hardware and software
   ~ mathematical computation nad algorithms
   ~ limitation of computers, can everything can be computed?
** Object of this Course: 
*** Notations for representing formal languages
    - ways of define them preisely
    - ways to build compilers that recognize them
    - way to check whether 
    ~~ a string of symbols belongs to a language
    ~~ two alternative descriptions of languages are actually the same language
** Tools to analyze languages
*** NL (natural language)
    recognize valid sentence
*** PL (programming language)
    recogmize vlaid program

** What gonna learn
   - Finite State Automaton
   - Regular Expression
   - Context-Free Grammar (CFG)
   - Pushdown Automaton
   - Turing Machine

** Language
*** Informal Definition:
    a system suitable for the expression of certain ideas, facts, or concepts, including a set of symbols and rules for manipulation.
    This is not sufficient, we need a precise definition for languages in  the threory of computation (Formal Language)
**** eg
***** "An arithmetic expression is constructed from variables and numbers, and infix operators +, -, *, /, and subexpressions may possibly be enclosed in paretheses, in which case every ( must have a corresponding "
***** "A Comment begins with /* and ends with */
***** Your password should have 4-8 characters and contain a non-alphabeticc character
**** Spoken Languages 
     they are not the formal language, although we can still try to write down rules that work most of the time
**** Conclusion
     the variable-name description is a combination of English and examples. We need some notation to express these descriptions more precisely
**** Formal Languages
     including the programming languages, database query languages, various file formats.
*** Formal Definition:
    we need to introduce several symbols and their definitions.
**** Alphabet
     a finite, nonempty set ∑ of symbols.
     ∑ = {a, b}, then abab, aaaabbba are strings on ∑
**** String (word)
     a finite sequence of symbols from the alphabet
     w = abaaa indicates the string named w has the specific value abaaa
**** Concatenation
***** def
      The concatenation of two strings  is obtained by appending the symbols to the right 
      end (concatenation is associative). 
***** eg
      w= 𝑎1 𝑎2 … 𝑎𝑛
      𝑣 = 𝑏1 𝑏2 … 𝑏𝑛
      𝑤𝑣= 𝑎1 𝑎2 … 𝑎𝑛 𝑏1 𝑏2 … 𝑏n
***** note
      if u, v, w are string and w=uv, then u is a prefix of w and v is a suffix of w.
      A proper prefix of w is a prefix that is not equal to ϵ (empty string) of w

**** Empty string (word)
     the string with no symbol the string with no symbols, denoted as ϵ.ls, denoted as ϵ.
     \|ϵ| = 0
     ϵw = wϵ = w
**** Length of a string 
     the number of symbols in the string, denoted as |w|
     \|𝑤1𝑤2| = |𝑤1| + |𝑤2|
**** Reverse of a string
     obtained by writing the symbols in reverse order, donated as w^R
     w = 𝑎1 𝑎2 … 𝑎n
     w𝑅 = 𝑎𝑛 … 𝑎2 𝑎1
**** palindrome
     A palindrome (回文) is a string w satisfying w = w^R
**** Star Closre of ∑
     ∑∗ (star closure of ∑) is the set of all strings (words) over the alphabet ∑
     it is infinite set
**** Positive Closure of ∑
     the positive closure of ∑, denoted by ∑+, is the set of all nonempty strings over the alphabet ∑
     it is infinite set
*** Formal Language Definition:
    - A formal language is a set of strings (sequences of symbols) constructed from a
      finite alphabet, according to a specific set of precise, mathematical rules. The key
      idea is that it is defined by its form, not its meaning .
    - a formal language L over alphabet ∑ is a subset of ∑∗
    - We can express new languages in terms of other languages using concatenation and 
      closure:
***** 𝑳1𝑳2 = { 𝑤1𝑤2 ∶ 𝑤1 ∈ 𝑳1 and 𝑤2 ∈ 𝑳2 }
***** 𝑳∗ = {𝑤1𝑤2 … 𝑤n ∶ n ≥0 and 𝑤1,𝑤2,… 𝑤n ∈ 𝑳}

** Grammars
*** Def
    Set of rules for generating syntactically correct programs/sentences
*** Example
    - 用一组**产生式规则来生成“句法正确”的句子/程序。
    - 本例是一个简化的上下文无关文法(Context-Free Grammar)（CFG），能生成一些英语句子。
**** CFG model
     - G = (V, Σ, R, S)
     - V：非终结符集合（可继续展开）→ 例如 S, subject phrase, object phrase, ...
     - Σ：终结符集合（不能再展开）→ 例如 he, she, a, the, dog, ...
     - R：产生式规则（A → α）
     - S：开始符号（start symbol），本例为 S

**** Grammar Rules
     - S → S and S | subject_phrase Verb object_phrase
     - subject_phrase → subject_pronoun | Article Noun
     - object_phrase → object_pronoun | Article Noun
     - subject_pronoun → he | she
     - object_pronoun → him | her | me
     - Article → a | the
     - Noun → dog | cat | mouse | house
     - Verb → sees | likes | finds | leaves

**** 读法提示
     - 竖线 | 表示or, 从左到右任选其一。
     - 终结符是实际输出的单词（he, a, dog, ...）。
     - 非终结符是“占位符”，要继续用规则替换，直到全是终结符为止。

**** 示例推导（Derivation）
     - 目标句：she sees a dog
       1. S ⇒ subject_phrase Verb object_phrase
       2. ⇒ subject_pronoun Verb object_phrase
       3. ⇒ she Verb object_phrase
       4. ⇒ she sees object_phrase
       5. ⇒ she sees Article Noun
       6. ⇒ she sees a Noun
       7. ⇒ she sees a dog

**** 连词 and 的含义
     - 规则 S → S and S 允许把两个句子并联：
     - 例：he likes the cat and she finds a mouse
     - 这是左递归写法；实际实现解析器时常改写以避免左递归。

**** Notes
     - 终结符 vs 非终结符别混：*she* 是终结符，*subject_pronoun* 是非终结符。
     - 这个文法能生成的只是“部分英语句子”，不是全英语；它只覆盖图里列的单词集合。
     - you can't define natural language completely in this way, but you ccan for programming languages.
