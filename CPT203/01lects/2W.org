* Software Process
** Software process & process model
- *Software Process*
  real set of activities, motheod, pratices used to develop & maintain software + related artifact
- *Process Model*:
  simplified abstraction / framework describing a process a high level
- No *perfect* process model

** The 4 fundamental process activities (super high frequency)
1. Specification (Requirements engineering)
2. Design & Implementation
3. Validation (V&V / testing)
4. Evolution (maintanance / change)

** Three key software process models (must be abiue to compare)
- Waterfull model:
  pharses in sequences
- Incremental development
  innterleave specification + development + validation;
  deliver versions (increments) of software
- Reuse-oriented SE:
  build mainly by integrating reusable components / services / systems
- can be combined in real projects

** Waterfull model
*** Pharses (in order)
1. Requirement analysis & definition
2. System & software design
3. Implementation & unit testing
4. Integration & System testing
5. Operation & Maintanance

*** Characteristics
- Linear / Sequential, Heavy documentation, phase deliverables + sign-off
- Iterations exist but are costly, parts may be frozen early, risking mismatch with user needs

*** Advantages:
Requirements are well-understood and unlikely to change (often critical / regulated systems)

*** Disadvantages:
- Inflexible to changes
- strong documentation / traceability
- disciplined control

*** Suitable:
- Requirements are well-understood and unlikely to change (often critical / regulated systems)


** Incremental Model
- Build system as series of version, each adds functionality
*** Incremental Definition
- spec/dev/validation are interleaved

*** Key Benefits
- early delivery of userful functionality
- cheaper to change while developing
- continuous user feedback
- risks discovered earlier

*** Limitations
- integration / dependency management gets complex
- risk of scope creep
- full functionality arrives later
- management coordination harder

*** Incremental vs Agile (easy to confuse)
- Incremental = planned increments, mode structured
- Agile = 
  - more flexible / time-boxed
  - stronger customer collaboration + faster adaptation

** Reuse-oriented Software Engineering (Component types tradeoffs)
*** Reuse-oriented idea
focus on integrating existing components rather than building from scratch
*** Types of reusable components
- web services (remote invocation, standard interfaces)
- Compoennt packages integrated with frameworks
- Stand-along systems configured for a particular enviornment
*** Reuse pros / cons
- Pros: 
  - less code to write 
  - lower cost / risks
  - faster delivery
- Cons:
  - requirements compromises;
  - less control over evolution
