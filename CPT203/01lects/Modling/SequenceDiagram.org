* Week 6: Sequence Diagram — Exam Cheat Sheet
** What is a Sequence Diagram
- A sequence diagram models interactions between objects over time.
- It focuses on message flow and time ordering.
- Commonly used to describe scenarios from use cases.

** Use Case vs Scenario
- Use Case:
  - A collection of possible interactions between actors and the system.
- Scenario:
  - One specific execution path through a use case.
  - A sequence diagram usually represents ONE scenario.

** Key Idea (Must Remember)
- Horizontal axis: participants (objects/actors)
- Vertical axis: time (top → bottom means forward in time)
- Emphasis is on the ORDER of messages.

** Participants (Objects)
- A participant represents an object or entity in the interaction.
- Drawn as a rectangle at the top of the diagram.
- Naming format:
  - objectName:ClassName
  - :ClassName (anonymous object)
- Each participant has a lifeline (vertical dashed line).

** Lifeline
- A dashed vertical line below a participant.
- Represents the existence of an object over time.

** Messages
- Messages represent communication between objects.
- Shown as arrows between lifelines.
- Message name and arguments are written above the arrow.

*** Synchronous Message
- Normal method call.
- Sender waits until the receiver finishes.
- Drawn with a solid arrow.

*** Asynchronous Message
- Sender does NOT wait for completion.
- Used for concurrent or event-driven calls.
- Drawn with an open arrowhead.

*** Return Message
- Shows the return of control or data.
- Drawn as a dashed arrow pointing back.

** Activation (Execution Specification)
- Shown as a narrow rectangle on a lifeline.
- Indicates that an object is executing a method.
- Nested activations represent nested calls or recursion.

** Control Structures (Frames)
- Frames are boxes drawn around parts of the diagram.
- Used to represent logic such as selection and loops.

*** Optional (opt)
- Represents an if condition without else.
- Executed only when condition is true.

*** Alternative (alt)
- Represents if/else logic.
- Conditions are separated by a dashed horizontal line.
- Only one branch executes.

*** Loop
- Represents repeated execution.
- Guard specifies loop condition or collection being iterated.

** Found Message
- A message with no explicit sender.
- Used when the sender is outside the scope of the diagram.

** Concurrency
- Asynchronous messages indicate concurrent behavior.
- Multiple activations can overlap in time.

** When to Use Sequence Diagrams
- To describe how objects collaborate to perform a task.
- To clarify complex logic and message ordering.
- To visualize interactions that are hard to explain in text.
- Useful for team discussion and design validation.

** Why Not Just Code
- Sequence diagrams are language-independent.
- Easier for non-programmers to understand.
- Show interactions among many objects on one page.
- Stay at a higher level than actual code.

** One-Line Exam Summary
- A sequence diagram shows how objects communicate with each other in time order to realize a specific scenario.
