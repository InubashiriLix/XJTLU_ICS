* Week 6: Activity Diagram — Exam Cheat Sheet
** What is an Activity Diagram
- An activity diagram models the workflow of a system or business process.
- It shows activities, decisions, concurrency, and synchronization.
- Commonly used in requirements analysis and system modeling.

** Basic Elements
*** Action
- Represents a single atomic step in a process.
- Cannot be decomposed further in the diagram.

*** Control Flow
- Arrows show the flow of control from one action to another.
- Indicates execution order.

*** Start Node
- Represented by a filled black circle.
- Marks the beginning of an activity.

*** Activity Final Node
- Represented by a bull’s eye (black dot with outer circle).
- Terminates the entire activity, including all concurrent flows.

*** Flow Final Node
- Terminates only the current flow.
- Other parallel flows may continue.

** Decision and Merge
*** Decision Node
- Represented by a diamond.
- Used to choose one path based on conditions.
- Outgoing flows have guards written in square brackets [ ].

*** Merge Node
- Represented by a diamond.
- Combines alternative paths back into one.
- Only one incoming path is active.
- Logical meaning: OR (one of many).

** Concurrency: Fork and Join
*** Fork Node
- Represented by a thick horizontal or vertical bar.
- Splits one flow into multiple concurrent flows.
- All outgoing flows execute in parallel.

*** Join Node
- Represented by a thick bar.
- Synchronizes concurrent flows.
- All incoming flows must complete before continuing.
- Logical meaning: AND (all must finish).

*** Merge vs Join (Must Remember)
- Merge:
  - Combines alternative paths.
  - Does NOT wait.
  - OR logic.
- Join:
  - Synchronizes parallel paths.
  - WAITS for all paths.
  - AND logic.

** Signals
*** Send Signal
- Represents sending a signal/event to another activity or system.
- Used for asynchronous communication.

*** Receive Signal
- Represents waiting for a signal/event before continuing.
- Execution pauses until the signal is received.

** Swimlanes
- Used to represent responsibility or roles.
- Each swimlane shows which actor/system performs an action.
- Control flow can cross swimlane boundaries.

** Time Events
- Trigger activities based on time conditions.
- Example: after a delay or at a specific time.

** When to Use Activity Diagrams
- To describe business workflows.
- To model complex logic with decisions and parallel steps.
- To clarify system behavior from start to finish.

** One-Line Exam Summary
- Activity diagrams show how actions flow, branch, run in parallel, and synchronize in a process.
