* Week 6: State Machine Diagram — Exam Cheat Sheet
** What is a State Machine Diagram
- A state machine diagram models the dynamic behavior of a system or object.
- It shows how an object changes state in response to events.
- Focuses on behavior over time rather than structure.

** Why State Machine Diagrams Are Needed
- Use case diagrams show WHAT the system does.
- Class diagrams show WHAT the system is made of.
- State machine diagrams show HOW the system behaves over time.
- Especially useful for reactive and real-time systems.

** Key Concepts
*** State
- A state represents a condition or situation during the life of an object.
- An object behaves differently depending on its current state.
- A class may have one or more states.

*** Event (Trigger)
- An event is something that happens at a point in time.
- Events may come from:
  - user input
  - messages
  - hardware signals
  - time conditions
- An event may cause a state change.

*** Transition
- A transition represents a change from one state to another.
- Triggered by an event.
- May include a condition (guard).
- May execute an action during the transition.

** Start and Terminate
*** Start State
- Indicates creation of an object.
- Represented by a filled black circle.
- Only one start state is allowed.

*** Terminate State
- Indicates destruction of an object.
- Represented by a bull’s eye.
- Marks the end of the object’s life.

** State Behavior
*** Entry Action
- Executed once when entering a state.
- Used for initialization.

*** Do Activity
- Executed continuously while the object remains in the state.
- Represents ongoing behavior.

*** Exit Action
- Executed once when leaving a state.
- Used for cleanup.

** Event and State Relationship
- An event must occur to trigger a transition.
- Without an event, the object remains in its current state.
- Conditions may restrict whether a transition occurs.

** Passive vs Active State
*** Passive State
- Describes the current values of an object’s attributes.
- Example: studentID, name, enrollmentDate.

*** Active State
- Describes what the object is doing.
- Example: New, Enrolled, Suspended, Graduated.

** State Hierarchy
*** Superstate
- A higher-level state that contains substates.
- Used to simplify complex diagrams.

*** Substate
- A state inside a superstate.
- Inherits behavior from the superstate.

** Benefits of State Hierarchy
- Reduces diagram complexity.
- Groups related states.
- Improves readability and reuse.

** Modeling Guidelines
- Identify states from use case scenarios.
- Identify events that cause state changes.
- Ensure each state has valid incoming and outgoing transitions.
- Avoid modeling trivial states.

** When to Use State Machine Diagrams
- Systems with event-driven behavior.
- Objects with complex life cycles.
- Real-time or embedded systems.
- Situations where order of events matters.

** Common Exam Mistakes
- Confusing states with actions.
- Forgetting events on transitions.
- Putting implementation details into states.
- Using state diagrams for purely data-driven logic.

** One-Line Exam Summary
- A state machine diagram shows how an object changes state in response to events throughout its lifetime.
