* Week 6: Use Case Diagram — Exam Cheat Sheet
** What is a Use Case Diagram
- A use case diagram shows how actors interact with a system.
- It gives an overview of system functionality from a user perspective.
- It focuses on WHAT the system does, not HOW it is implemented.
- Diagrams are helpful but secondary to textual use case descriptions.

** Purpose of Use Case Diagrams
- Define the system boundary.
- Capture functional requirements.
- Identify user goals.
- Support system design and test case generation.
- Built early in the development lifecycle.

** Core Elements
*** Actor
- An actor represents a role that interacts with the system.
- An actor can be a human or an external system.
- An actor must be external to the system.

*** Types of Actors
- Primary actor:
  - Has goals fulfilled by the system.
- Supporting actor:
  - Provides a service to the system.
- Offstage actor:
  - Has an interest in the system but does not directly interact.

*** Use Case
- A use case represents a system function or process.
- Named using a verb or verb phrase.
- Each use case describes a user goal.
- A use case may be automated or manual.

*** System Boundary
- Represented as a rectangle.
- Defines what is inside and outside the system.
- Actors are always outside the system boundary.

*** Association
- A line connecting an actor to a use case.
- Indicates communication or interaction.
- No arrow direction is usually required.

** Finding Actors
- Ask:
  - Who are the primary users?
  - Who needs system support for daily tasks?
  - Which external systems interact with the system?
  - Who has an interest in the system output?
- One real-world entity may play multiple actor roles.

** Finding Use Cases
- Identify user goals.
- Look for services the system must provide.
- Use verbs to describe actions.
- One goal usually maps to one use case.

** Relationships Between Use Cases
*** Include Relationship
- Used to represent mandatory behavior.
- The base use case always executes the included use case.
- The included use case cannot stand alone.
- Used to avoid duplication of common behavior.
- Logical meaning: MUST happen.

*** Extend Relationship
- Used to represent optional or conditional behavior.
- The base use case can execute without the extension.
- Extension happens only under certain conditions.
- Logical meaning: MAY happen.

*** Generalization
- Represents inheritance between use cases or actors.
- The child inherits behavior from the parent.
- The child may add or specialize behavior.
- Used to represent variations of a general use case.

** Include vs Extend (Very Important)
- Include:
  - Mandatory
  - Reusable behavior
  - Tight coupling
- Extend:
  - Optional
  - Conditional behavior
  - Loose coupling

** Use Case Levels
- High-level use cases:
  - Describe business goals.
- User-goal level use cases:
  - Describe tasks completed by a user.
- Sub-function use cases:
  - Support higher-level use cases.

** Common Mistakes (Exam Traps)
- Using nouns instead of verbs for use case names.
- Modeling UI steps as use cases.
- Putting actors inside the system boundary.
- Using include when behavior is optional.
- Using extend when behavior is mandatory.

** When to Use Use Case Diagrams
- To communicate system scope.
- To discuss requirements with stakeholders.
- To validate system functionality.
- To identify missing requirements.

** One-Line Exam Summary
- A use case diagram shows actors, their goals, and how they interact with a system within a defined boundary.
