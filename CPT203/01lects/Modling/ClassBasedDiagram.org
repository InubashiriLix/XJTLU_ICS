* Week 6: Class-based Model (Domain Model) — Exam Cheat Sheet
** What is a Domain Model
- A domain model illustrates meaningful conceptual classes in a problem domain.
- It represents real-world concepts, NOT software components.
- Focuses on WHAT exists in the domain, not HOW it is implemented.

** Features of a Domain Model
*** Domain Classes
- Each domain class represents a type of real-world object.
- It describes a set of things sharing common features.

*** Attributes
- Attributes describe properties of a domain class.
- Each object instance holds its own attribute values.
- Attributes preserve information required by the system.

*** Associations
- Associations describe relationships between domain classes.
- They show how object instances are linked.
- Associations can define roles and multiplicity.

** Steps to Create a Domain Model
1. Identify candidate conceptual classes.
2. Draw them using a UML Class Diagram.
3. Add necessary associations to capture relationships.
4. Add attributes required to retain essential information.

** Types of Domain Classes
- External entities (e.g. customer, clerk)
- Physical things (e.g. product, court)
- Events or occurrences (e.g. reservation, payment)
- Roles (e.g. member, instructor)
- Organizational units (e.g. department, school)
- Places (e.g. classroom, stadium)
- Structures (e.g. timetable, schedule)

** Identifying Classes
*** Analyze Requirements
- Examine use cases to find key entities.
- Look for objects that retain important information.

*** Noun–Verb Analysis
- Nouns → candidate classes.
- Verbs → candidate operations or responsibilities.

*** Domain Knowledge
- Use understanding of the problem domain.
- Identify common entities and relationships.

*** Identify Responsibilities
- Each class should have one clear responsibility.
- Avoid classes that do too many unrelated things.

*** Identify Relationships
- Look for:
  - Aggregation / Composition (whole–part)
  - Inheritance (generalization–specialization)

** Class Selection Characteristics (Exam Favorite)
A class should be selected if it has:
1. Retained information (data must be remembered)
2. Needed services (operations required by system)
3. Multiple attributes (not just a single value)
4. Common attributes across instances
5. Common operations across instances
6. Essential role in system requirements

** Class Naming Rules
- Use nouns as class names.
- Use meaningful, pronounceable names.
- Use CamelCase naming style.
- Avoid ambiguous or obscure abbreviations.
- Avoid digits in class names.
- If you cannot read it aloud clearly, rename it.

** Associations
- An association represents a relationship between classes.
- Common meaning: “has a” or “uses”.
- Associations connect two or more classes.

*** Association Name
- Use verbs to name associations.
- Arrows can be used to improve readability.

*** Multiplicity
- Defines how many instances can participate.
- Common multiplicities:
  - *       → zero or more
  - 1..*    → one or more
  - 1       → exactly one
  - 1..40   → one to forty
  - 3,5,8   → exactly 3 or 5 or 8

** Association vs Aggregation vs Composition
*** Association
- Objects are aware of each other.
- Objects have independent lifecycles.
- Example: Employee uses Equipment.

*** Aggregation
- A weak “has-a” relationship.
- Contained objects can exist independently.
- Example: Department has Employees.

*** Composition
- A strong “part-of” relationship.
- Contained objects depend on container lifecycle.
- If container is destroyed, parts are destroyed.
- Example: Company contains Departments.

** Implementation Perspective (Conceptual Only)
- Association: object holds a reference to another object.
- Aggregation: object contains other objects but does not manage lifecycle.
- Composition: object creates and destroys contained objects.

** Attributes
- Attributes describe an object’s state.
- Selected from use cases and requirements.
- Must retain information required for system operation.
- Data types and access modifiers are NOT required at analysis stage.

** One-Line Exam Summary
- A class-based (domain) model represents real-world concepts using classes, attributes, and relationships to describe the problem domain.
